Welcome to PS>Attack!

Get-Attack will let you search through the built in attacks to find what you're looking for.

The search will look through the description of the attacks as well as some predefined
categories. Those categories are:

[*] Recon
[*] Passwords
[*] Exfiltration
[*] Code Execution
[*] File Tools
[*] Network
[*] Latteral Movement

Get-Attack Examples:
[*] get-attack netcat
[*] get-attack passwords
[*] get-attack smb

Once you find an attack you want to try, you can find out more about the command with the
get-help command. You can also use the -Examples parameter with 'get-help' to view examples
of using most commands.

Get-Help Examples:
[*] get-help invoke-mimikatz
[*] get-help invoke-mimikatz -Examples
